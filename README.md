# StoreFront
Storefront is a mobile app that allows shoppers to easily find the products they are looking for in stores, and store owners the ability to easily add their product selection to the store layout for customers to search, thus saving them time and money.

This project was implemented using the following **Firebase** services: **Authentication**, **Cloud Functions**, **Storage**, and **Firestore**.
